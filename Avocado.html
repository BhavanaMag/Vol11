To make a beautiful peach color from avocado skins and pits, follow the recipe below: <br>

Step 1: Prepare Avocado Skins and Pits <br>

Save up about 5-6 avocado skins and pits for dyeing 1 yd of cloth. <br>
You can freeze them in a bag and use them when needed. <br>
Wash the pits and skins thoroughly to remove all the remnants of the fruit residue. <br>
The color actually depends on how clean the skin is. <br>

Step 2: Make the Dye Bath <br>

Roughly chop the skins and pits in your pot as shown in the first picture above. <br>
Add enough water to cover them by about 2-3 inches. Simmer gently for 45-60 mins. <br>
Turn off the heat and let it steep for a few hours or overnight for a richer tone. <br>
Strain out solids using a fine sieve or cloth. <br>

Step 3: Color Variations <br>

If you add vinegar water (ratio 1:4) the color becomes a darker peach. <br>
Baking soda (1 tsp per cup) makes the color shift to a coral pink. <br>

Please share with me the colors you obtain if you try this out. I'd love to see new shades. <br>

Here is a fabric artwork I made after dyeing a white cloth with avocado. <br>
The design is inspired by Mr. Sudhiranjan Mukherjee from Santiniketan, India. <br>
