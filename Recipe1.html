A few slices of the loaf. <br>

<h4>Recipe:</h4><br>
<p>
Ingredients:  1-2 ripe bananas, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup vegetable oil (such as canola), <br>
 1/2 cup white granulated sugar,1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1/2 cup flaxmeal, 1 1/2 cups flour, <br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, <br>
1 cup of pecans <br> 

Roast the pecans lightly in a pan and keep aside. <br>
Mash the bananas thoroughly using a blender. If overripe, they can be mashed with a spoon!<br>  
Mix the wet ingredients, and then add the dry ingredients to it. Sitr until everything is blended.<br>
Pour into a greased pan. I like to spray my pan with canola oil, but you can also use melted butter. <br>
I recommend using parchment paper if you are concerned about the batter sticking to the pan. <br>
Bake at 350°F for about 40 mins or until a fork, when inserted into the bread, comes out clean. <br>
Bring out of the oven and let the bread cool on the rack for half an hour.<br>
Slice into thick pieces, and enjoy as a snack.
