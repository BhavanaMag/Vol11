<h4> Batik Tapestry and T-shirt Designs</h4>

This tapestry is inspired by a design found on a terracotta plaque used to embellish 
the walls of the Madan Mohan temple in Bishnupur, West Bengal, India. <br>
Historical evidence suggests, this temple was constructed by Durjan Singha in 1694 CE.
It has been declared a national monument in India.<br>
While the original panel depicts a mother with her chicks, the tapestry studies the form <br>
of Canada geese, commonly seen in the Western New York. The artist was inspired to study <br>
how geese gathered together in large groups, cackled, and dug for worms in the mud. <br>
The batik technique is believed to have originated in South Asia, wherein a wax resist is used <br>
 to prevent color from seeping into certain portions of the fabric, while allowing others to get dyed. <br>
The use of bright colors is common, as is the use of vegetable dyes such as turmeric, indigo, and others.

This work is inspired by a design created by Jamuna Sen, the daughter of Nandalal Bose, the pioneer of <br>
modern Indian art and former principal of Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan, appointed by Rabindranath Tagore. <br>
Jamuna Sen and her elder sister Gouri Bhanja, along with other talented artists like <br>
Rani Chanda, Haimanty Chakravarty, and Bani Bose co-created a legacy that became <br>
synonymous with the Santiniketan style of batik. <br>

A Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamuna_Sen) mentions: <br>
<p>
Pratima Devi, Rabindranath Tagore's daughter-in-law, had learnt the techniques of Batik in <br>
  Paris from a French artist, and in 1923, brought this knowledge as well as some Batik instruments <br>
  to Santiniketan. With the help of the French artist Andrée Karpèles, she started a small workshop to <br>
  explore this technique further. Later Silpa Bhavana (precursor of the current Silpa Sadana) <br>
  would develop this practice on a larger scale. It is in this venture that Jamuna, along with her sister <br>
  Gouri would come to play a key role. <br>

The design on this T-shirt is inspired by the common motif of a lotus and water plants found in the Ajanta cave-paintings. <br>
The artist used a simplified version of this design in a repetitive pattern. <br>
