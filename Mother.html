<h4>Ode to my mother</h4>

<p>
Rabindranath Nath Tagore says
"I cannot remember my mother,
only when from my bedroom window I send my eyes into
the blue of
the distant sky,
I feel that the stillness of my mother's gaze on my face
has spread all over the sky."

<p>
The utterance of the word MOM 
Brings before my eyes the face of a woman.
She is the most beautiful woman in the world,
Possessing a remarkable character.
No one can take her place in this world.
</p>
<p>
God has created mothers because 
He himself cannot take care of all 
his children at the same time
She is the woman who can solve 
any types of problems at one go.
She is a great cook, 
A full-fledged gardener,
An ideal mother 
And that is why she is my mother.
</p>

<p>
She is the one who wipes away my tears
When I am sad and share all my problems,
sorrows
And she is never tired of doing all this.
</p>

<p>
She is the person who wakes up early in the morning,
Before anyone does
And goes to sleep after everyone,
She does all the household work.
God perhaps has gifted her with 
All the energy to do work,
She gets very little time to spend on herself
</p>

<p>
And because of all these, she is a mother
My lovely mother
</p>

<p>
As a daughter, I praise her very little,
She is my mother and only my mother.
</p>

<p>
May God bless her and give her 
all the happiness of her life.
