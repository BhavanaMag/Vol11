<h4>Ode to my mother</h4>

<p>
Rabindranath Nath Tagore says <br>
"I cannot remember my mother,<br>
only when from my bedroom window I send my eyes into<br>
the blue of<br>
the distant sky,<br>
I feel that the stillness of my mother's gaze on my face<br>
has spread all over the sky."<br>

<br>
<p>
The utterance of the word MOM <br>
Brings before my eyes the face of a woman.<br>
She is the most beautiful woman in the world,<br>
Possessing a remarkable character.<br>
No one can take her place in this world.<br>
</p>
<p>
God has created mothers because <br>
He himself cannot take care of all <br>
his children at the same time<br>
She is the woman who can solve <br>
any types of problems at one go.<br>
She is a great cook, <br>
A full-fledged gardener,<br>
An ideal mother <br>
And that is why she is my mother.<br>
</p>

<p>
She is the one who wipes away my tears <br>
When I am sad and share all my problems, <br>
sorrows <br>
And she is never tired of doing all this.<br>
</p>

<p>
She is the person who wakes up early in the morning,<br>
Before anyone does<br>
And goes to sleep after everyone,<br>
She does all the household work.<br>
God perhaps has gifted her with <br>
All the energy to do work,<br>
She gets very little time to spend on herself<br>
</p>

<p>
And because of all these, she is a mother <br>
My lovely mother <br>
</p>

<p>
As a daughter, I praise her very little, <br>
She is my mother and only my mother.<br>
</p>

<p>
May God bless her and give her <br>
all the happiness of her life.<br>
</p>
